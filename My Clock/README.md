MyClock is a simple console-based clock application written in C++ that offers two main features:

1. **Stopwatch**: It allows you to measure elapsed time in hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.

2. **Countdown Timer**: You can set a countdown timer by specifying hours, minutes, and seconds, and the program will count down to zero.

## Program Goals

The primary goals of this program are:

1. **Fun**: MyClock is designed to provide a fun and interactive experience for users who want to explore stopwatch and countdown timer functionality in a console environment.

2. **Demonstrate Logic**: The program showcases logical programming skills by implementing stopwatch and countdown timer features, demonstrating how to handle time-related operations in C++.

3. **Training**: MyClock serves as a training exercise for programmers interested in C++ development. It provides an opportunity to practice input validation, timekeeping, and basic console interaction.

While MyClock is a simple project, it can serve as a foundation for learning more about C++ programming and developing console-based applications.
